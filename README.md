# QMESE Experiment

Please avoid communication between groups and do not listen in on other participants from your own group. Run the code in Codespaces without installing additional tools. Using the internet for code guides/tutorials is allowed, but copying reports directly is not permitted (AI is also obviously not allowed).

The quality of an individual student’s work will not be evaluated in any way, so there’s no need to worry about it!

## Part I
### Group 1:
In pairs, open the file **graph_algorithms.java**  
(The method of working in pairs is up to you: two computers, one computer, continuous communication, or simply discussing reported errors.)

### Group 2:
Individually examine the file **graph_algorithms.java**

## Part II
### Group 1:
Individually examine the file **tree_and_binary_search.java**

### Group 2:
In pairs, open the file **tree_and_binary_search.java**  
(The method of working in pairs is up to you: two computers, one computer, continuous communication, or simply discussing reported errors.)
